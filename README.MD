# Project

Simple project with some tools. Well i used React router dom as my routers, context api and Localstorage to set states of authentication, react-icons library to get some cool icons, styled-components to set my whole style in project. I used too Firebase to storage some files as pictures. In backEnd i used NodeJs/express/dotEnv/Cors as my frameworks/libraries to create funcionalities, i used too as ORM, Mongoose to create models between my backend and my db on MONGODB. I also used BCRYPT AND JWT libraries to create my user Authentication account Manager. As my fetch requisitions i used AXIOS, that for me is actually the best tool to do this.

## Funcionalities

- Authenticate Pages
- Admin Dashboard
- API REST as service
- Redirection Pages
- Blog with db informations
